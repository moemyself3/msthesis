\section{Eclipsing Binary Characterization}
Binary stars can reveal physical properties by examining the light curves.
Current models use a process called WD code.

In this thesis a modified WD code will be used from the Physics of Eclipsing Binaries (PHOEBE)

\section{Pipeline for variable star detection}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Data needs to be cleaned first.
    \item Align frames
    \item Extract sources
    \item Cross match sources with catalogs
    \item Create Database of known sources
    \item Plot individual light curves
    \item Analyze individual light curves for variability estimation
    \item Sort database given variability ranking
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data Acquisition}
Eclipsing binary optical data acquisition requires an observer to take time series ccd photometry of one target with an observation cadence dependent on the period.

A cadence can be determined by 

For example, the data gathered for this project was collected on multiple nights and observed on the order of hours with evenly timed frames.
